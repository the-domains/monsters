# Risk Delight

## Presence and attention 

Courage is choosing to enjoy each moment received when there is so much to be up-in-arms about. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f24dfc0d-b7e8-4547-af24-1c0a8c38e86e.jpg)

When I took a sabbatical several years ago, the dark skinned grapes of late summer spoke out loud and light gold set fire to the fading afternoon. The grapes spoke of darkness and depth, places only slow twisting roots can know of. It was at this time, that I found myself in a new personal orientation to a land and community I had not listened to in my rush to some place else each morning. With hands and feet rooted to land and place day after day, the earth accepted and I relinquished all sorrow in return for tenfold smiles. Jack Gilbert writes, 

## A Brief for the Defense

Sorrow everywhere. Slaughter everywhere. If babies  
are not starving someplace, they are starving  
somewhere else. With flies in their nostrils.  
But we enjoy our lives because that's what God wants.  
Otherwise the mornings before summer dawn would not  
be made so fine. The Bengal tiger would not  
be fashioned so miraculously well. The poor women  
at the fountain are laughing together between  
the suffering they have known and the awfulness  
in their future, smiling and laughing while somebody  
in the village is very sick. There is laughter  
every day in the terrible streets of Calcutta,  
and the women laugh in the cages of Bombay.  
If we deny our happiness, resist our satisfaction,  
we lessen the importance of their deprivation.  
**We must risk delight**. We can do without pleasure,  
but not delight. Not enjoyment. We must have  
the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless  
furnace of this world. To make injustice the only  
measure of our attention is to praise the Devil.  
If the locomotive of the Lord runs us down,  
we should give thanks that the end had magnitude.  
We must admit there will be music despite everything.  
We stand at the prow again of a small ship  
anchored late at night in the tiny port  
looking over to the sleeping island: the waterfront  
is three shuttered caf√©s and one naked light burning.  
To hear the faint sound of oars in the silence as a rowboat  
comes slowly out and then goes back is truly worth  
all the years of sorrow that are to come.
