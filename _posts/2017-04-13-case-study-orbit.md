User experience and co-creation is an underutilized approach for both startups and established companies to manage the risk and change associated with major updates.

Imagine walking into your kitchen to make a cup of coffee to find that the drawers and cabinets had all been rearranged. With software the impact is greater because shipping a new feature or update can affect thousands and thousands of people who depend upon your product everyday, its like rearranging the kitchen, or the highways for that matter, of an entire city, a sure way to turn users into haters, most recently check out [Snapchat's big redesign][0] with an 83% disapproval rating---ouch. The Amazon Fire is another debacle that skipped out on user research. 

Snapchat is a social app. If you were redesigning the administrative interface responsible for managing public and private clouds that hospitals, governments, and entire data centers depend upon for mission critical applications, a company just might think or design a little more carefully. I'm sure the designers at Snapchat worked pretty hard to roll out their redesign. At VMware we accomplished a major redesign to wide applause. 

At VMware R&D User Experience, I worked closely for several months with senior interaction designers, user researchers, and engineers to roll out a significant update to the navigation and object model of VMware's VSphere client. I'd love to tell you more about our user testing, incorporating feedback, co-creation workflows, and inter-disciplinary collaboration methods that reduced risk and won approval of new and existing customers .
