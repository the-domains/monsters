Imagine walking into your kitchen to make a cup of coffee to find that the drawers and cabinets had all been rearranged. With software the impact is perhaps greater because shipping a new version of your product can affect thousands and thousands of people who depend upon your product everyday.

The VSphere client is a complex web based administrative tool for managing public and private clouds. Clouds that hospitals, governments, and entire data centers depend upon for mission critical applications. To make a significant change required 

To keep up with the increased number of managed objects the VSphere client required a fundamental change to its user interface. 

administerAt VMware evolving the complex administrative environment of the VSphere clientDuring my time at VMware R&D Users Experience This analogy is fantastic when creating new products, but when changing an existing product, care must be taken not to disrupt the existing user base. I've crossed this threshold a number of times, however, the most robust and successful experience I've had was during my time at VMware, when I worked closely with the designer Peter Shepherd.

One of my go to frameworks to apply during product development that helps to user research is the Jobs to Be Done defines a product as something one hires to get a job done. I love this analogy because it inevitably sparks team curiosity and user research activities. The more one strives to understand the job a user is wants to achieve, the easier it is to build a product, through shared understanding, and subsequent acceleration of development and delivery.
