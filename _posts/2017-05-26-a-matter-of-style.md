_Excerpt from "What We Think About When We Try Not to Think About Global Warming", by Per Espen Stoknes._

At a seminar, poet Gary Snyder was once asked, "Why bother to save the planet?" He replied with a grin: "Because it's a matter of character and a matter of style!"

What I really like about his answer is that it does not attempt to found our actions on some plausibility calculation of success or failure, or on a dualistic ethics---the good fight against evil. Rather Snyder points to our calling and to aesthetics, both realms of the soul, of being who we are. This grounds our long-term actions in something more substantial than the expectations of a quick and successful outcome of our efforts. For sure, early wns and successes are welcome and wanted. We just can't make our long-term efforts dependent on them.
