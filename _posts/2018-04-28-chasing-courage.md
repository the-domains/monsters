# Chasing Courage

## Monsters lie waiting, like rogue waves threatening to drag you out to sea.

Some challenges are so big, they keep you up at night, threatening to drag you out to sea like a rogue wave. For many of the startups and enterprises I work with, this could be digital transformation, engineering cadence, growth strategy, fundraising, or just trying not to drown from overwhelm. Through personal and professional explorations I've learned shift my relationship to such challenges.

In 2013, I began an in-depth personal look at one of the largest monsters on the planet---climate change. During my explorations, I biked hundreds of miles commuting 25 miles each way to work, I attended conferences and joined local activist groups, I learned about community organizing and hosted a film screening of Chasing Ice, I spoke in public and hosted a workshop. During that time, I cycled through many dark emotions from overwhelm to righteousness, despair to apathy, fear and anger. Monsters in our professional, personal, or political lives thrive on fear and anger, seducing the best of us down paths of resistance that siphon our energy and distract us from the gift and bounty of our true nature.

What I learned, with help from the youngest people in my life, is that life is precious and lullaby's are beautiful. 

### We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking that created them.

Tack towards a new course and put your monsters to bed. Ready to shift your relationship to the monsters in your world? [Say hello][0]
