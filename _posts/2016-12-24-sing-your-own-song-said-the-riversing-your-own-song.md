> Sing your own song, said the river, Sing your own song.

_"Sing your own song,_ said the river,  
_"Sing your own song._

_"Out of yesterday song comes._  
_It goes into tomorrow,_  
_Sing your own song._

_"With your life fashion beauty,_  
_This too is the song._  
_Riches will pass and power. Beauty remains._  
_Sing your own song._

_"All that is worth doing, do well, _said the river_._  
_Sing your own song._  
_Certain and round be the measure,_  
_Every line be graceful and true._  
_Time is the mold, time the weaver, the carver,_  
_Time and the workman together,_  
_Sing your own song._

_Sing well,_ said the river. _Sing well."_
