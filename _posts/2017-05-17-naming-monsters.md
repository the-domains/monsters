# Kyōkotsu

## To recognize is to reclaim.

---

Flee from the spirit well and welcome   
A shade of helpless unease, fury and resistance.   
Drop low and hunker, a pin prick of the moment,   
Low the still morning stands of saw grass, golden.  
Breath dark ripples in pools gathering beneath the chest.   
Welcome the contribution of ghosts and locate the ease of uncertainty.

Recognize what is undone through reaction and resistance  
A quality unveiled by the call to arms and defiance.   
Name the shade, beckon near, befriend the rising spirit.

Acknowledge without action, reclaim that exhausted in flight.   
Welcome the aether of being and acceptance, alignments found   
weaving the bark of redwood groves as alternatives emerge.   
The nature of abundance lies near.
