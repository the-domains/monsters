# Lullabies of Change

## The pendulum is always in motion

At the height of the dot com boom, I was working at a hardware company in Silicon Valley. My responsibilities included maintaining a collection of microcode for digital signal processors, a very specialized kind of work on the internals of digital cameras and DVD players, not unlike a heart surgeon. 

I recall my manager at the time and standing in front of his cubicle. He was from Romania and decades older than I, his accent thick, his beard short and grey. "Why the long face," he asked me and I lamented about politics and why everything was headed in seemingly the wrong direction. 

He smiled and told me that the politics of democracy are never still and always in motion, like a pendulum it sways in one direction and then another. His words brought me comfort and to this day I know that change is the only constant in this life. I know that the stories and narratives we tell one another and listen are constantly healing and transforming not only ourselves but our world too. So much so that despair, overwhelm, and destruction no longer appear fearsome but merely way points in the creation of new futures.

The books below tell stories about the futures of restoration and celebration in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.
