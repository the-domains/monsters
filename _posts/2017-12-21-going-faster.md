  not go faster by jumping up and down. You will not go faster by spreading

# Going Faster

You will not go faster in a rush.  
You will not go faster by command.  
You will not go faster by jumping up and down.  
You will not go faster by spreading yourself thin.  
You will not go faster by thinking hard or figuring it out.

Stop to listen. Trust what's light and follow.  
Take good care of yourself and those around you.  
Speed takes flight through an embrace of the present.
