# Project Drawdown

Last week I attended Paul Hawking's project Drawdown book launch event. I had been following the project for about two years after attending a GreenBiz sustainability conference where I met the executive director. The project is a survey of the solutions to climate change that the world can do right now. Drawdown is the point in time when emissions from human activities turn around and begin decreasing.

During Paul's presentation, he said, "Drawdown is possible, because it happens every year." Then he showed the following video from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in southern California.

In this video, you'll notice that as the year progresses through March levels of CO2 rise to high levels and that by August they are drawn down, like a collective breath. And that breath is the growth of all the vegetation that essentially draws down the CO2 from the atmosphere and transforming it into branches and leaves, roots and shoots.

The room was clearly inspired at this point. Our collective goal, humanity's collective goal is to bring online the projects
