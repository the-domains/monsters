# Project Drawdown

Last week I attended the book launch of Paul Hawken's Drawdown project. I had been following the progress for about two years after attending a GreenBiz sustainability conference where I first met the executive director Amanda Ravenhill. The project is plan to reverse global warming that we can all do today. The book ranks the top 100 activities by comparing the reduction in CO2, net cost, and net savings. Drawdown is the point in time when emissions from human activities turn around and begin to decrease, and it happens every year.

> Drawdown is possible, because it happens every year.

There was a buzz in the room as the room collectively witnessed the drawdown captured by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's satellite visualization. You'll notice that as the year progresses through March, levels of CO2 emissions reach an abnormally high levels to match economic activity picking up in the northern hemisphere. By August, emissions are drawn down, as a collective breath. The accelerated growth of vegetation pulls CO2 from the atmosphere and transforms it into branches and leaves, roots and shoots. The ocean too absorbs much of the CO2\. This isn't to say that we can just let nature do its thing, since we're nearing the limits of what the ocean and vegetation can handle. 

Humanity's challenge is here in front of us. The race is on to reach Drawdown, and when we get there, we all win.
