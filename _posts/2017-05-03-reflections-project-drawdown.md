There was a buzz in the room as the room collectively witnessed the drawdown captured by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's satellite visualization.

> Drawdown is possible, because it happens every year.

You'll notice that as the year progresses through March, levels of CO2 emissions reach an abnormally high levels to match economic activity picking up in the northern hemisphere. By July, emissions in the northern hemisphere are drawn down, like a collective breath. The accelerated vegetation growth pulls CO2 from the atmosphere and transforms it into branches and leaves, roots and shoots. The ocean too, absorbs much of the CO2\. However, this isn't to say that we can just let nature do its thing, since we're emitting more than the natural system can completely absorb.

Humanity's challenge is here before us. The race is on to reach Drawdown, and when we get there, we all win.
