TBWritten

* Popular game 10k/month to run
* Redis cluster many many GB
* Pawnstars, History Channel 
* Zero downtime or players will be unhappy and sales lost
* Redis is in memory and to turn it off means to lose all memory 
* Moving many GB is slow
* transfer to new hardware options (cheaper) at aws with zero downtime
* Coordinate without failure
* From complex to easy.
