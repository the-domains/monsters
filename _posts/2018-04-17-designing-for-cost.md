When Fifth Column Games launched Pawn Stars, a companion game for the popular History Channel reality show, the success of their game led to millions of users with 24/7 in-app purchases and $10k+ AWS hosting costs.

Migrating a 12GB Redis cluster in flight with 0 down time? Festina lente.

* Popular game 10k/month to run
* Redis cluster many many GB
* Pawnstars, History Channel
* Zero downtime or players will be unhappy and sales lost
* Redis is in memory and to turn it off means to lose all memory
* Moving many GB is slow
* transfer to new hardware options (cheaper) at aws with zero downtime
* Coordinate without failure
* From complex to easy.
