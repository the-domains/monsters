# Playing and Iterating with Restorative Ecosystem Business Models

What if iterating on your business model wasn't tough and hard but more closely related to play? You and your team are working together, with wide smiles and good humor, making decisions that feel good and removing everything that isn't a contribution. With alignment and confidence, strategy unfolds and plans emerge. The steps are clear for you to raise capital, build a team, scale your process, and accelerate the change in the world you are capable of achieving. 

So what is stopping you? Complexity, fear, overwhelm, uncertainty, doubt. To have courage is to follow your heart amidst the din. Our ecosystems have elected us to become stewards of life and community, water and forest---to redefine the fundamental human-economic relationships we have with nature today. 

I'm here to help, to meet your team, and learn about the challenges you face. Facilitation & Collaboration. Ideation & Iteration. Process & Tools. [Say Hello][0]
