  What if iterating on your business model wasn’t tough and hard but more
  closely related to play? You and your team are working together, with wide
  smiles and good humor, making decisions that feel good and removing everything
  that isn’t a contribution. With alignment and confidence, strategy unfolds and
  plans emerge. The steps are clear for you to raise capital, build a team,

# Prototyping Restorative Ecosystem Business Models

What if iterating on your business model wasn't tough and hard but more closely related to play? You and your team are working together, with wide smiles and good humor, making decisions that feel good and removing everything that isn't a contribution. With alignment and confidence, strategy unfolds and plans emerge. The steps are clear for you to raise capital, build a team, scale your process, and accelerate the change in the world you are capable of achieving.

So what is stopping you? Complexity, fear, overwhelm, uncertainty, doubt. To have courage is to follow your heart amidst the din. Our ecosystems have elected us to become stewards of life and community, water and forest---to redefine the fundamental human-economic relationships we have with nature today.

I'm here to help and make the impossible possible, to meet your team, and unpack the challenges you face. Facilitation & Collaboration. Ideation & Iteration. Process & Tools. [Say Hello][0]
