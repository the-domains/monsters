# The Greatest Threat

After their "fangs" are brushed, we go into their bedroom and close the door. The curtains are drawn, there are no toys. The big ones get their pajamas on then quietly spread out clothes beside their bed for the next day. All the while, I sit on the floor humming gentle lullabies and play finger games with the smallest in a hushed voice "this little monster went to the market, this little monster went to the beach..." The excitements of the day have unwound and I light a candle to read a fable by the soft warm glow.

My little monsters lie peaceful in their beds finally at rest, like grey granite stones in a field of green grass. I gaze upon their faces and like swans they are the epitome of hope and beauty, wonder and grace. I will do anything to keep them safe and with a peaceful heart, I blow out the candle on another day.

In the cloak of darkness my hand is on the doorknob, and I stop because I don't want leave. You see, out there, beyond their bedroom door are where the big monsters lie waiting like rogue waves that drag you out to sea. Monsters like school massacres and drunk drivers, bullies and crushed bones. But perhaps the greatest threat to the future of my little monsters is our rapidly changing climate.
