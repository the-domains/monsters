  After their fangs are brushed, we go into their bedroom and close the door.
  The curtains are drawn, there are no toys. The big ones get their pajamas on
  then quietly spread clothes for the following day. All the while, I sit on the
  floor humming gentle lullabies and play finger games with the smallest in a
  hushed voice (this little monster went to the market, this little monster went
  to the beachâ€¦). The excitements of the day have unwound and I light a candle
  to read a fable by its soft warm glow.

After their fangs are brushed, we go into their bedroom and close the door. The curtains are drawn, there are no toys. The big ones get their pajamas on then quietly spread clothes for the following day. All the while, I sit on the floor humming gentle lullabies and play finger games with the smallest in a hushed voice (this little monster went to the market, this little monster went to the beach...). The excitements of the day have unwound and I light a candle to read a fable by its soft warm glow. 

My little monsters lie peaceful in their beds finally at rest, like grey granite stones in a field of green grass. I gaze upon their faces and like swans they are the epitome of hope and beauty, wonder and grace. I will do anything to keep them safe and with a peaceful heart, I blow out the candle on another day. 

In the cloak of darkness my hand is on the doorknob, and I stop because I don't want leave. You see, out there, beyond their bedroom door are where the big monsters lie waiting like rogue waves that drag you out to sea. Monsters like school massacres and drunk drivers, bullies and crushed bones. But perhaps the greatest threat to the future of my little monsters are fossil fuel companies and their contribution to our rapidly changing climate.
