  “All mankind is tied together; all life is interrelated, and we are all caught
  in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of
  destiny...For some strange reason I can never be what I ought to be until you
  are what you ought to be. And you can never be what you ought to be until I am
  what I ought to be - this is the interrelated structure of reality.”

# The Interrelated Structure of Reality

"All mankind is tied together; all life is interrelated, and we are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny...For some strange reason I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. And you can never be what you ought to be until I am what I ought to be - this is the interrelated structure of reality."
