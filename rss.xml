You are together with others from many disciplines, wide smiles and good humor, decisions that chink and feel good. Alignment and confidence wrap you with a golden warmth, strategy unfolds and plans emerge. You sleep well and raise capital that has never been easier, assumptions fall like dominos, investment gleams, process scales, our change and impact in the world accelerates.</p>,<p>So what is stopping you? Complexity, fear, overwhelm, uncertainty, doubt. To have courage is to follow your heart amidst the din. Our ecosystems have elected us to become stewards of life and community, water and forest—to redefine the fundamental human-economic relationships we have with nature today.</p>,<p>Want help to make the impossible possible, to unpack the challenges you face on to floor and .<br>Facilitation &amp; Collaboration.
